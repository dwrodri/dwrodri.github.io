<h2>I stole your CSS, so now I'm giving you credit</h2>

<p>I'm one of those people who constantly likes change. That change is often in the
name of optimization. A new Vim keybind for a command I execute often while
working. A new shell alias to get to a config file I find myself editing often.
Working at the speed of thought is a very satisfying thing. When it came to
building a personal website, I took a similar approach by stealing hints from
all my favorite CSS layouts and gluing them together to make my own. Here is the
list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">This website</a>,
which speaks for itself.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">58 Bytes of CSS looks great everywhere</a> is another 
example in the same vein, but less extreme.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a> because I stare at it so much the
design is somewhat etched in my brain. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">This Guy</a> for being another
evangelist on the topic of website obesity.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051201042652/http://www.youtube.com/">The Older YouTube landing
pages</a> get
an honorable mention because they have a nice homey feel to them. Maybe this
is just me realizing that I'm not a kid anymore. </p></li>
</ul>
