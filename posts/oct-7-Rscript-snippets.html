  <h2>R is a joy if you treat it like awk</h2>
  <p><sup><i>October 7th, 2019 - Derek Rodriguez</i></sup></p>
  <p>During my undergrad I took a data science class. It was a great class
  where we dove into topics such as EDA, lasso regression, SVMs,
  visualizations, and many other good things that other people across the
  Internet love to blog about ad nauseum. The one thing I had a terrible
  experience with was R. Let me clarifyâ€”R is a fantastic environment for
  statisticians to explore advanced computation methods on cleaned data. It is
  also a great environment for developing great insights on clean data using
  their DataFrame type. If you haven't caught the hint yet, <strong>R's true
  potential is so much more immediate if your data is already
  great</strong>.</p>
  <p>The sad reality of most exciting data science projects is that they more
  often than not aren't based on a clean, well-studied dataset. Thank God
  Tensorflow changed their default tutorial away from digit recognition,
  because MNIST has quickly become the Wonderwall of computer vision. The
  reality is half of data science is just cleaning data, and the other half is
  complaining about how much of data science is just cleaning data. You can add
  another half's worth of time for debugging your neural net, if you were
  coaxed into using one that isn't off-the-shelf.</p>
  <p>Half-assing something in Unix can produce great results as long you chose the
  right half of the ass. Thirty minutes of of some good cURL mixed with awk
  and/or some sed perform miracles on poorly-formatted plaintext source.
  Python's scientific libraries (PySpark, pandas, etc.) do a decent job
  of copying R's DataFrame magic and even allowed for it to scale to multi-node
  architectures. That being said, criticizing R for all the awkwardness that
  comes from a language developed by a bunch of a statisticians is absolutely
  not the point of the post.</p>
  <p>I came to an important realization. R is a Unix tool.
  Throwing an R snippet into a command just like you would with awk or sed
  opens a whole new world of possibility. It blows my mind that isn't R isn't
  shown in this context more often. If R is bad at cleaning your data, you can
  just clean it in awk and then just pipe to R. I've actually reduced my R
  usage down to mostly just two aliases (written here in fish syntax):</p>
  <pre>
    alias stats 'Rscript -e "summary(as.numeric(readLines(\"stdin\")))"'   
    alias boxplot 'Rscript -e "boxplot(as.numeric(readLines(\"stdin\")))"'
</pre>
  <p>The first produces a quick numeric summary of a series of numbers on
  stdin. The second produces a boxplot with that same data in PDF format. For
  example, let's say I've just bought a new server and I want to see how long
  it takes to spin up a web app after a crash. I would write a script that
  simulates a crash, and then logs the recovery time after each crash and saves
  it in a file called output.log. If I wanted a boxplot of the total recovery
  times, all I would have to do is:</p>
  <pre>
$   grep "Recovery time:" output.log | awk '{print $2}' | boxplot
</pre>
  <p>No spinning up Rstudio. No messing with ggplot settings. No more
  oh-my-god-why-how-do-I-just-get-this-into-a-list. Just results that help you
  figure do some quick-and-dirty EDA. I'd love it if people e-mail me some R
  snippets like the one I shared here so I can add them to my running list.</p>

  <p><i>Update:</i> I got some really great feedback from this article on 
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21183983">HN</a>. I've taken a 
  stab at rewriting the post a little to emphasize the original intent of 
  recontextualizing R as a great command-line tool, instead of as the core language
  for a data science / statistics programming ecosystem.</p>
