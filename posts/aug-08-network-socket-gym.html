<p><sub><i>  August 8th, 2018 - by Derek Rodriguez</i></sub></p>
<p>A couple months ago I stumbled across <a href="http://cs230.stanford.edu/files_winter_2018/projects/6940282.pdf">this paper</a> and thought it was pretty cool. “Deep Q-Learning looks cool, let’s give it a go.” I thought to myself. Then I remembered I don’t have a colossal HPC cluster at my disposal to do things like <a href="https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/">make a DoTA 2 AI that goes toe-to-toe with the pros</a> and I got sad. &quot;Well, maybe I can offload the simulation of the card game to that Raspberry Pi I have sitting around and do all the learning on my desktop". Thus, the idea of an AI Gym with a socket interface was born.</p>
<p><i>"That sounds like something OpenAI Gym already does by default. This isn’t new at all."</i></p>
<p>You’re <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40195740/how-to-run-openai-gym-render-over-a-server">right</a>. There is no such thing as originality, everything new is old, no one is special and art is a lie. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s note that apparently in the age of smart thermostats, cloud-connected everything, and Docker witchcraft, OpenAI Gym instances <em>still run on locally on your machine</em>. In case you didn’t know, it takes a <strong>long</strong> time to send a packet over a network—in terms of CPU cycles, that is.</p>
<p><em>How</em> long, you ask? If your CPU is ticking away at anywhere around 3GHz, and it’s executing one instruction per tick, you’d be able to execute roughly <strong>1.5 million</strong> instructions before that packet could do a round trip around a single data center. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html">Here are the numbers I used to do the math</a>. For something like blackjack, where each round of play isn’t going to take more than a couple thousand instructions, this meant I would need the hardware that would support several thousand threads of execution. Looks like were back at the DoTA-2-playing HPC mega-cluster. Well, it was worth a thought.</p>
<p>That being said, since that calculation was essentially done on the back of a napkin, I could be very wrong. I’ve begun making <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/blackjack_gym">my own blackjack gym</a> just to be certain that it isn't worthwhile. I’ve been hired to be a TA for a programming class at my university this semester, and I need to brush up on my C programming skills anyways.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> After several months of torturing myself with graduate school fellowships, I've finally got almost all the necessary logic done for the blackjack gym. Realistically, once I get splitting hands implemented, then I can fork my work and start rolling out netcode. </p>
