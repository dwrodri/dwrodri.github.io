    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm an aspiring researcher from Costa Rica. I'll be a NSF STARS Fellow at Northeastern University starting this Fall. Before that, I got my B.S. in Computer Science at Clemson University. </p>

    <p>When I'm not programming, working on school, or writing stuff to post here, I like to record and produce music. I started off with electronic music as a teenager, but have since expanded into jazz and rock/metal. When I'm not making music, I'm gaming, playing squash, skateboarding, or looking for a warm tropical beach to sit on.</p>

    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>I've written most of the HTML on this site by hand, and I have a few shell scripts that keep things up to date. Be aware that I use Google fonts for font hosting.</p>
