## Why You should care about this blog
First off, if you're trying to hire me, [here's my résumé](http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dwrodri/). For those of you who are just looking for reading material (how did you find this page already?), I'll do my best to tag and sort. I have no clue how frequent I'll be blogging at this point, that probably won't be a commitment I'll make for a long time. Odds are I'll write a book's worth one month and have two posts the next. My main focus throughout 2018 will be coding, not blogging, so most of my activity will be traceable through my [GitHub](https://github.com/dwrodri).

## About Me

I was originally, born in Seattle, WA, but I was raised in Costa Rica. I've since returned to the US for my education. My main interests are:

* Computational Intelligence
* Computer Security
* HPC
* Distributed Computing
* Game Programming

I intend for this blog to focus on just those interests–but who
knows? If people actually start reading my stuff and are genuinely interested in
my personal life, then I might start writing about the stuff I do in my free time
that probably won't get me employed full-time.
