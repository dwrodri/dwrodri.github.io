## I Stole your CSS, so now I'm giving you credit

I'm one of those people who constantly likes change. That change is often in the
name of optimization. A new Vim keybind for a command I execute often while
working. A new shell alias to get to a config file I find myself editing often.
Working at the speed of thought is a very satisfying thing. When it came to
building a personal website, I took a similar approach by stealing hints from
all my favorite CSS layouts and gluing them together to make my own. Here is the
list.

* [This website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/),
  which speaks for itself.

* [58 Bytes of CSS looks great everywhere](https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/) is another 
example in the same vein, but less extreme.

* [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) because I stare at it so much the
  design is somewhat etched in my brain. 

* [This Guy](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) for being another
  evangelist on the topic of website obesity.

* [The Older YouTube landing
  pages](https://web.archive.org/web/20051201042652/http://www.youtube.com/) get
  an honorable mention because they have a nice homey feel to them. Maybe this
  is just me realizing that I'm not a kid.
