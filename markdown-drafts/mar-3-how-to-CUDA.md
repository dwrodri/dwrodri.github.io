# My notes on CUDA
### Derek Rodriguez
_These notes assume some basic understanding of C, C++, threads, and computer
architecture._

CUDA is a programming runtime/language extension based on C++ that allows
for programmers to execute general purpose code on GPUs (Graphics Processing
Units). CPUs are usually designed to be capable of executing between 8-64 
threads at once, but GPUs can execute thousands of threads at once. This is 
made possible because the cores on a GPU are much simpler than those on a GPU. The key difference between GPU and
CPU designs is that CPU cores are much better at handling code with lots of
conditional statements, whereas GPUs are meant to have very little control flow
and lots of math. GPUs
