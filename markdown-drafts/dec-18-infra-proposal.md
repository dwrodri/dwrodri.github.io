# Data Ownership Through Semi-Public Infrastructure: A Proposal

## TL;DR
* We as a society have let large corporations violate our personal privacy
* Large tech companies should still be allowed to exist, but we need some sort
  of contractual obligation.
* Follow in the footsteps of successful predecessors and make the
  warehouse-scale computing centers that the big tech corporations rely
  semi-public entities that __aren't__ controlled by big tech, but instead are
  co-owned by system administrators who handle them.
