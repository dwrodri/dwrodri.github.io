    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm an aspiring researcher from Costa Rica. I'm currently attending <a href="https://clemson.edu">Clemson University</a>, where I am studying computer science and mathematics. As of right now, the best way to pursue a career in research appears to be graduate school, but I'm not opposed to other options that would allow me to keep learning.</p>

    <p>When I'm not programming, working on school, or writing stuff to post here, I like to record and produce music. I started off with electronic music as a teenager, but have since expanded into jazz and rock/metal. When I'm not making music, I'm gaming, playing squash, skateboarding, or looking for a warm tropical beach to sit on.</p>
