        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>This is the collective list of all my project ideas. Most of them are just that—ideas. Some I've started work on. Some I've got into working condition. I am a strong believer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>. Please keep in mind that whilw all of these projects fascinate me, it is highly unlikely I will "finish" all of them any time soon. If you're up to the task, feel free to take any ideas on this list and finish them for me. My (non-binding) request is that you contact me when you have an MVP so I can thank you. Here are the categories:</p>
        <h3>No meaningful work done</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An open-source clone of the <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> text editor that tries to measure the compare of various parameters of your writing and compare them to famous prolific authors. Recurrent neural nets would be fun but likely ineffective.</li>
            <li>A library with multiple language bindings that facilitates the implementation of capsule nets.</li>
            <li>An eBook on the fundamentals of StarCraft II aimed at AI programmers. The book will focus more on undertanding how to play the game instead of how to develop software that plays the game.</li>
            <li>A framework for quickly deploying user-friendly frontends for academic publication repositories. Inspired by <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">the arXiv sanity preserver.</a></li>
            <li>An application suite that can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi to convert into a cheap alternative to a <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-89-titanium">TI-89 graphing calculator</a>. </li>
            <li>A computer program that can algorithmically generate IUPAC names just based on skeleton structure. It would be fun to see how different neural networks perform at this task despite the fact that a much simpler method could certainly be used.</li>
            <li>Develop a data-driven approach to "reverse engineering" synthesizer patches. Current candidates are simple multivariate linear regression and recurrent neural networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some work started, but FAR from finished</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Didakt: automated curriculum generator for topics in computer science. Currently just a landing page. <a href="http://didakt.me/">Link here.</a> </li>
            <li>Ozone: A C++17 library/game engine written to expedite the development of CPU-intensive 2-D games. Forte will be exceptional debugging tools and profiling tools. Proposal has been started, but draft is not yet complete.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prototype/MVP in development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Eckert_Sim: A cycle-accurate CPU simulator written in C with a simple RISC architecture and microinstructions. <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/eckert_Sim">Repo link here.</a></li>
            <li> LQTLD3: Linear Quadtrees with Level Differences in Python 3. Currently capable of generating functional quadtrees, but I want to see if I can support k-map reduction. <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/LQTLD3">Repo link here.</a> </li>
            <li> PyPelt: A fuzzy logic controller framework targeted for embedded microprocessors written in Python 3. <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/PyPelt">Repo link here.</a> </li>
            <li> A Sharp: a tool for learning music theory on guitar. Props to <a href="https://github.com/lczarne">Logan Czarnecki</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/TraceyKing864">Tracey King</a> for assisting with development. let me know if you want a different link here and I'll update this page. <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/a_sharp"> Repo link here.</a> </li>
        </ul>
