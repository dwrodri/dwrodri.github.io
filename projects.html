  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>This is the collective list of all my project ideas. Most of them are just
  thatâ€”ideas. Some I've started work on. Some I've got into working condition.
  I am a strong believer in <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>.
  Please keep in mind that while all of these projects fascinate me, it is
  highly unlikely I will "finish" all of them any time soon. If you're up to
  the task, feel free to take any ideas on this list and finish them for me. My
  (non-binding) request is that you contact me when you have an MVP so I can
  thank you. Here are the categories:</p>
  <h3>Prototype/MVP that runs in some form</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Eckert_Sim: A cycle-accurate CPU simulator written in C with a simple
    RISC architecture and microinstructions. <a href=
    "https://github.com/dwrodri/eckert_Sim">Repo link here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>LQTLD3: Linear Quadtrees with Level Differences in Python 3. Currently
    capable of generating functional quadtrees, but I want to see if I can
    support k-map reduction. <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/LQTLD3">Repo
    link here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>PyPelt: A fuzzy logic controller framework written in Python 3.
      <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/PyPelt">Repo link here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>A Sharp: a tool for learning music theory on guitar. Props to
      <a href="https://github.com/lczarne">Logan Czarnecki</a> and <a href=
      "https://github.com/TraceyKing864">Tracey King</a> for assisting with
      development. let me know if you want a different link here and I'll
      update this page. <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri/a_sharp">Repo link
      here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>BJGym: a light-weight, multi-threaded RL environment for the blackjack
    card game written in C. Designed to be easily built for many different
    platforms. Maybe down the line it will support multiple card games, and
    multi-agent self-play. Has yet to reach an alpha stage. <a href=
    "https://github.com/dwrodri/blackjack_gym">Repo Link here.</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Big Projects with Design Project in Place</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Didakt: automated curriculum generator for topics in computer science.
    Currently just a landing page. <a href="http://didakt.me/">Link here.</a>
    </li>
    <li>Ozone: A C++17 library/game engine written to expedite the development
    of CPU-intensive 2-D games. Forte will be exceptional debugging tools and
    profiling tools. Proposal has been started, but draft is not yet
    complete.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>No meaningful work done</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>An ncurses preview window for your command, with some sort of safeguard
    to prevent execution in the midst of typing the command.</li>
    <li>A software suite for smart coffee machines that provides the same
    coherent UI across different coffee machines</li>
    <li>A video scraper for 9anime.is in Python</li>
    <li>An anlternative to <a href="https://coinhive.com/">CoinHive's</a>
    JavaScript browser plugin, but it mines a more popular crypto, and there's
    a desktop client showing you which sites have requested usage, you can
    control what resources are used for mining.
    </li>
    <li>A deep learning system that can render a top down visualization of a
    soccer game in ASCII art from footage.</li>
    <li>A useful CLI interface for cloud services that works with Google Drive,
    Dropbox, and OneDrive.</li>
    <li>An open-source clone of the <a href=
    "http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> text editor that tries to
    measure the compare of various parameters of your writing and compare them
    to famous prolific authors. Recurrent neural nets would be fun but likely
    ineffective.
    </li>
    <li>A grammar engine plugin for vim</li>
    <li>A CLI tool that takes unlabeled source code through stdin and attempts
    to detect the programming language</li>
    <li>A library with multiple language bindings that facilitates the
    implementation of capsule nets.</li>
    <li>An eBook on the fundamentals of StarCraft II aimed at AI programmers.
    The book will focus more on undertanding how to play the game instead of
    how to develop software that plays the game.</li>
    <li>A framework for quickly deploying user-friendly frontends for academic
    publication repositories. Inspired by <a href=
    "http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">the arXiv sanity preserver.</a>
    </li>
    <li>An application suite that can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi to convert
    into a cheap alternative to a <a href=
    "https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-89-titanium">
      TI-89 graphing calculator</a>.
    </li>
    <li>A computer program that can algorithmically generate IUPAC names just
    based on skeleton structure. It would be fun to see how different neural
    networks perform at this task despite the fact that a much simpler method
    could certainly be used.</li>
    <li>Develop a data-driven approach to "reverse engineering" synthesizer
    patches. Current candidates are simple multivariate linear regression and
    recurrent neural networks.</li>
    <li>A ridiculously over-engineered ripoff of DrugWars in C++.</li>
  </ul>
