<h2>About this Website</h2>

<p> I've created this website as a place to talk about my work and what I've learned, what I've done, and what I
    plan to do. I've got a lot going on right now, so there will probably be very few updates until I really get the
    ball rolling.
</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>Here is an abridged list of my interests, as I currently enter graduate school:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Using machine learning to make operating systems run faster </li>
    <li> Quantitative finance, asset pricing, and algorithmic trading </li>
    <li> Documenting and understanding the "hacks" that go into making Deep Learning models useful in practice</li>
    <li> Making GPU drivers better </li>
    <li> Simulations and game engines </li>
    <li> High performance scientific computing, especially using GPUs </li>
    <li> Application security, and tangentially web security </li>
    <li> The LLVM project </li>
    <li> Procedural Generation </li>
<p>If these topics interest you, then make sure to come back often. Once I have my own IP address, I intend to
   self host my own website and start building a mailing list + RSS feed for people to keep up with my work.</p>
