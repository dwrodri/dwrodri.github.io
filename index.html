<h2>About this Website</h2>

<p> I've created this website as a place to talk about my work and what I've learned, what I've done, and what I
    plan to do. I've got a lot going on right now, so there will probably be very few updates until I really get the
    ball rolling.
</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>Expect to see a lot about data science, deep learning, and visualization on here. Occasionally, I might talk about some of
    my other technical interests, like computer security, distributed computing, game programming, and
    cryptocurrency (but there's already plenty written about that). I expect my future employment (whatever that
    may be) to involve a lot of writing, so I'm getting this off the ground  with the intent of resharpening my
    writing skills, as well as keeping a record of things that others might find interesting.</p>
