<h2>Why You should care about this blog</h2>

<p>First off, if you're trying to hire me, <a href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dwrodri/resume.pdf">here's my résumé</a>. For those of you who are just looking for reading material (how did you find this page already?), I'll do my best to tag and sort. I have no clue how frequent I'll be blogging at this point, that probably won't be a commitment I'll make for a long time. Odds are I'll write a book's worth one month and have two posts the next. My main focus throughout 2018 will be coding, not blogging, so most of my activity will be traceable through my <a href="https://github.com/dwrodri">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I was originally, born in Seattle, WA, but I was raised in Costa Rica. I've since returned to the US for my education. My main interests are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computational Intelligence</li>
<li>Computer Security</li>
<li>HPC</li>
<li>Distributed Computing</li>
<li>Game Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>I intend for this blog to focus on just those interests–but who
knows? If people actually start reading my stuff and are genuinely interested in
my personal life, then I might start writing about the stuff I do in my free time
that probably won't get me employed full-time.</p>
