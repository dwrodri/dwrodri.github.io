  <h2>About this Website</h2>
  <p>I've created this website as a place to talk about my work and what I've
  learned, what I've done, and what I plan to do. I've got a lot going on right
  now, so there will probably be very few updates until I really get the ball
  rolling.</p>
  <h2>What to Expect</h2>
  <p>Here is an abridged list of my interests, as I currently enter graduate
  school:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using machine learning to make operating systems run faster</li>
    <li>Quantitative finance, asset pricing, and algorithmic trading</li>
    <li>Documenting and understanding the "hacks" that go into making Deep
    Learning models useful in practice</li>
    <li>Making GPU drivers better</li>
    <li>Simulations and game engines</li>
    <li>High performance scientific computing, especially using GPUs</li>
    <li>Application security, and tangentially web security</li>
    <li>The LLVM project</li>
    <li>Procedural Generation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If these topics interest you, then make sure to come back often. Once I
  have my own IP address, I intend to self host my own website and start
  building a mailing list + RSS feed for people to keep up with my work.</p>
